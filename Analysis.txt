Problem 0: O(1) 
The overall time complexity will be O(1) as the code doesn't depend on the input size(or the data size).

Problem 1: O(n)
Because we are accessing the first and last values from the lists (calls and texts) by an index

Problem 2: O(n)
Because we are accessing the first and last values from the lists (calls and texts) by an index

Problem 3: O(nlogn)
Because we are accessing the first and last values from the lists (calls and texts) by an index and sorting

Problem 4: O(n)
Because we are accessing the first and last values from the lists (calls and texts) by an index and sorting
